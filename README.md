# ZIP Bruteforce Password
A simple bruteforce attack for zip files with passwords where you only need a word list and a zip with the password in the same directory to run this code

## Usage
to use the code you can run the code with this sample command 


```
python3 main.py
```

and you need the zip and wordlist files in the same directory because the filenames for the zip and wordlist we put in main.py example:  

```
main.py
secret.zip
rockyou.txt
```
